即将为大学四年的第7个学期画上句号，在这三年半中也学了不少计算机的课程。如果让我选在这四年中，哪门课最令我受益匪浅，我一定毫不犹豫地选择在19年秋季学期修的Berkeley CS 189(Introduction to Machine Learning)。即使课程过去了整整一年，无论是在自己的研究中，或者是和别的刚入门的同学们之间进行探讨时回顾这门课的内容，都能学到一些新的内容。因此我觉得即使上完了这门课，我也依然有必要对课程内容进行回顾，并且希望通过在网上发布blog的形式监督自己并且和各位对机器学习有兴趣的同学进行分享。Blog的语言我决定使用英语，一来是希望训练自己使用英文进行学术写作的能力，二来我学习这门课的时候全部使用的都是英文，用中文总觉得怪怪的。发布了任何新的blog我都会把链接放在这个post里面，希望与各位共勉。



Approaching the end of the 7th semester of my undergrad life, I've taken a variety of CS courses in the past three and a half years. If anyone would like to know which course benefitted me the most, I would have no hesitation to choose CS 189, Introduction to Machine Learning, which I took in Berkeley in the Fall semester, 2019. Even if it has been a whole year since I took it, I was able to learn a lot when I had some review on the course contents not only in my own research projects, but also in the discussions with other neophytes in machine learning. Therefore, I think it is necessary to have some review on it. I'd like to prompt myself to persist in this work as well as sharing this fabulous course with other machine learning lovers by posting blogs online. In addition, I decided to take English as my primary language of the posts since I'd like to practice my English academic writing skills. Also, I took this course in English and I'm not familiar with the Chinese translations of some terms as well as some expressions. I'll put the links down in the post whenever I've written anything new.
